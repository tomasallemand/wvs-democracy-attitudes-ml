        "Q250 is measured on a 1–10 scale. The distribution in this sample is strongly right-skewed — consistent with what political scientists typically find in surveys conducted in countries with historically rooted democratic values, where respondents tend to cluster at the higher end of the scale.\n",
        "\n",
        "Given this skew, treating Q250 as a continuous or multi-class target would create severe sparsity in the lower range. The variable was therefore binarized using a threshold of 8: respondents scoring 1–8 are grouped as the \"lower valuation\" class (0), and those scoring 9–10 form the \"higher valuation\" class (1).\n",
        "\n",
        "This threshold was chosen after examining the cumulative distribution of Q250: roughly 75% of valid responses fall at or below 8, creating a moderate class imbalance (~3:1 ratio). To address this directly in the model, the `scale_pos_weight` hyperparameter in XGBoost was included in the grid search — this parameter penalizes misclassification of the minority class proportionally to the imbalance ratio, without requiring oversampling or data augmentation.\n",
        "\n",
